# hello
I don't want to be inconvenienced to wake up at 6 am for course selection. This program will automatically open chrome on my computer, navigate to the Ryerson portal, bypass 2 factor authentication
To make this program work you will have to download selenium drivers.
You also have to be a ryerson student
By default this program is set to Fall 2021 schedules(Program knows to select this semester for registration). This is a demonstration.
